# Machine Learning A-Z Course Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the exercises from the "Machine Learning A-Z" course on Udemy. The exercises cover various topics in machine learning, including regression, classification, and clustering. The exercises are basic with small datasets and less features. I plan to extend the projects as an end-to-end pipline with API production.

## Table of Contents

- Data processing templates
- Regression problems
- Classification problems
- Clustering problems
- Association rule learning
- Reinforcement learning
- NLP
- Deep learning
- Dimensionality Reduction

## Data Processing Templates

The data processing templates section includes exercises focused on preparing and preprocessing the data for machine learning tasks. You will find templates and techniques for handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and more.

## Regression Problems

The regression problems section contains exercises related to regression tasks. You will work with various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and others. Each exercise presents different datasets and regression scenarios.

## Classification Problems

In the classification problems section, you will find exercises that revolve around classification tasks. You will explore different classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision trees, ensemble methods (e.g., random forest and XGBoost), and more. The exercises cover diverse datasets representing different classification scenarios.

## Clustering Problems

The clustering problems section focuses on unsupervised learning and clustering techniques. You will encounter algorithms like k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and others. These exercises aim to identify natural groupings and patterns within the data.

## Association Rule Learning

In the association rule learning section, you will work with exercises related to discovering associations and relationships between items in datasets. You will explore algorithms like Apriori and Eclat to mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

## Reinforcement Learning

The reinforcement learning section introduces exercises focused on reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## NLP

In the NLP section, you will explore exercises related to natural language processing. You will work with text data and perform tasks such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, text classification, and building language models using techniques like bag-of-words.

## Deep Learning

The deep learning section covers exercises centered around deep neural networks and deep learning architectures. You will work with frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras to build and train deep learning models for various tasks such as image classification.

## Dimensionality Reduction

The dimensionality reduction section focuses on exercises related to reducing the dimensionality of the data. You will explore techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to visualize high-dimensional data and improve the efficiency and interpretability of machine learning models.

## Requirements

To run the exercises, you may need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies.
3. Navigate to the respective exercise folder (regression, classification, clustering and so on).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) to access the exercise solutions and implementations.
5. Read the instructions, run the code cells, and modify them as required.
6. Feel free to experiment, tweak the models, and explore alternative solutions.
7. Document your findings and observations within the notebooks.
8. Enjoy learning and practicing machine learning with the exercises!
