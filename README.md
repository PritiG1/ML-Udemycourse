## Regression

In the regression folder, you will find exercises related to regression problems. Each exercise focuses on different regression techniques and datasets, providing hands-on experience with algorithms such as linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and more.

## Classification

The classification folder includes exercises that delve into classification problems. You will explore different classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forest and XGBoost. The exercises cover datasets representing diverse classification scenarios.

## Clustering

In the clustering folder, you will find exercises centered around unsupervised learning and clustering techniques. You will encounter algorithms like k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, and apply them to various datasets to identify natural groupings and patterns within the data.

## Requirements

To run the exercises, you may need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies.
3. Navigate to the respective exercise folder (regression, classification, clustering).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) to access the exercise solutions and implementations.
5. Read the instructions, run the code cells, and modify them as required.
6. Feel free to experiment, tweak the models, and explore alternative solutions.
7. Document your findings and observations within the notebooks.
8. Enjoy learning and practicing machine learning with the exercises!
